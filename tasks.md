# Tasks · Sveska

> **At session start, read this file first.** It holds the active ticket and the next 3–5 sequential ones. Older / completed work is summarized for context but should not be re-litigated.

## In progress

- [ ] **T2.5 — Fuzzy search across notes (title + body) + quick-capture inbox**
  - **Why**: scale beyond 5–10 notes — need fast multi-field search. Inbox is a one-line quick-capture (Ctrl+Shift+K-ish) that drops a row into the `inbox` Dexie table without leaving the editor.
  - **AC**: `Ctrl+P` opens a fuzzy modal that searches title + body of all non-deleted notes; under 50ms for 1k notes; Enter opens the selected note in a tab. Inbox modal lives alongside; a small badge in the rail shows unprocessed count.
  - **Don't**: pull `fuse.js` if a hand-rolled scorer can hit 50ms. The corpus is small (1k notes × ~5KB bodies = 5MB max). Bigram + substring scoring is enough.

## Next up (sequential, top-down)

- [ ] **M2 close** — tag `v0.2.0-m2`, release notes

## Cross-cutting (any milestone)

- [ ] Lighthouse PWA report on `sveska.studio` — verify ≥90 in PWA category
- [ ] Wire `landing.html` → real `/marketing` (or apex when M6 lands)
