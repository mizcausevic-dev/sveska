# Tasks · Sveska

> **At session start, read this file first.** It holds the active ticket and the next 3–5 sequential ones. Older / completed work is summarized for context but should not be re-litigated.

## In progress

- [ ] **T2.2 — Version history per note + diff compare view**
  - **Files**: extend `src/notes/snapshotRepo.ts` with `getVersionsForNote(id)` (already there as `listSnapshots`) · new `src/lib/diff.ts` (line-level diff, pure) · new `src/editor/VersionsModal.tsx` (left = current body, right = snapshot body, with +/- gutters and restore button) · open via existing Snapshot toolbar "Restore last" → expand to list
  - **AC**: opens a modal listing all snapshots newest-first with timestamp + first-line preview; clicking one shows side-by-side diff vs current body; Restore button writes the snapshot body back to the active note; diff handles unicode + diacritics
  - **Don't**: pull a diff library (myers-diff etc) yet — write a simple LCS line diff. Library swap is M3 if Markdown render needs richer diff.

## Next up (sequential, top-down)

- [ ] T2.3 — Unsaved-draft recovery (crash/refresh safe)
- [ ] T2.4 — Tags, pinned notes, saved filters, recent-notes rail, favorites bar
- [ ] T2.5 — Fuzzy search across notes (title + body) + quick-capture inbox · **AC**: 1k notes, search < 50ms
- [ ] **M2 close** — tag `v0.2.0-m2`, release notes

## Recently done (this branch only)

## Cross-cutting (any milestone)

- [ ] Bind Hostinger DNS token from `~/ftpkred.txt` to a GH Secret + CI step so DNS changes can be PR'd
- [ ] Add `npm test` + `pnpm lint` to PR-required checks once main is branch-protected
- [ ] Lighthouse PWA report on `sveska.studio` — verify ≥90 in PWA category
- [ ] Wire `landing.html` → real `/marketing` (or apex when M6 lands)
